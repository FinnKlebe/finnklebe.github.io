I am a final-year PhD Candidate in the Department of Political Science at University College London (UCL). In Fall 2024, I am a visiting researcher at the Center for Political Studies (CPS) at the University of Michigan. My research interests lie at the intersection of international relations and political sociology with a research agenda that evolves around the study of difficult-to-observe conflict processes. I try to better understand (informal) relations between conflict actors through the collection of original primary data during fieldwork and the analysis of this data through multi methods designs, using historical process tracing and spatial econometric approaches. <br><br>


In my dissertation, I focus on organizational alliances in the anti-apartheid opposition in South Africa, providing evidence for a web of often informal relations between organizations in a fragmented and divided opposition landscape. I leverage primary data from archives in South Africa, constructing a dataset with cooperative and competitive relations for 147 anti-apartheid organizations (political parties, trade unions, religious organizations, student organizations, civic organizations, armed groups). This work has implications for a more nuanced assessment and measurement of relations during conflict. <br><br>


Besides my dissertation, I have expanded my research agenda through several additional projects. My research is forthcoming in the <em>Journal of Peace Research</em>. My work in progress looks at the impact of international sanctions on alliances in conflict, the logic of alliance building in resistance movements that face repression. I have furthermore started a large-N cross-national data collection effort on informal alliances, measuring defection and co-membership among UCDP rebel organizations on the African continent.
